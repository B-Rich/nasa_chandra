<h2>About Chandra X-ray Observatory:</h2>
<!-- <p class="date">December 07, 2006</p> -->
<br>
<p>The Chandra X-ray Obervatory was launched by the NASA Columbia shuttle in 1999. Named after Indian-American physicists Subrahmanyan Cahndrasekhar, &ldquo;Chandra&rdquo; also means &ldquo;luminous&rdquo; in Sanskrit.</p>
<p>X-ray optic measurements are usually taken from space with satellite instrumentation to produce the best 2-dimensional angular resolution. This is because x-rays are absorbed in the Earth&rsquo;s atmosphere. &nbsp;So in order to collect x-ray data, the instrumentation needs to be above the atmosphere. &nbsp;As a result, the Chandra X-ray Observatory is located in orbit around the Earth height above the interfering atmosphere. The Chandra X-ray Observatory has three major parts: (1) the X-ray telescope, whose mirrors focus X-rays from celestial objects; (2) the science instruments which record the X-rays so that X-ray images can be produced and analyzed; and (3) the spacecraft, which provides the environment necessary for the telescope and the instruments to work.</p>
<p>The instrument we will be focusing on in the is project is Advanced CCD Imaging Spectrometer (ACIS). This is one of two focal plane instruments. This instrument is an array of charged coupled devices (CCD's), which are sophisticated versions of the crude CCD's used in digital cameras. This instrument is especially useful because it can make X-ray images, and at the same time, measure the energy of each incoming X-ray. Thus scientists can make pictures of objects using only X-rays produced by a single chemical element, and so compare (for example) the appearance of a supernova remnant in light produced by oxygen ions to that of neon or iron ions. It is the instrument of choice for studying temperature variations across X-ray sources such as vast clouds of hot gas in intergalactic space, or chemical variations across clouds left by supernova explosions. &nbsp;</p>

<h2>CIAO &amp; CALDB</h2>
<br>
<p>Analytical software and algorithms are thus needed to produce accurate observations of Chandra observations. The Chandra X-Ray Observatory provides such software in the form of the &ldquo;Chandra Interactive Analysis of Observations&rdquo; or CIAO. &nbsp;CIAO is a flexible software suite that allows analysis of X-ray data collected from the Chandra Observatory as well as non-X-ray data from other missions. The CSC (Chandra Source Catalog) is a publicly accessible database that has combined data for most of the Chandra mission. One of the tools provided in the suite is called <a href="http://cxc.harvard.edu/ciao/ahelp/dmimgadapt.html">dmimgadapt</a> which we will be used as a basis for the project.</p>

<h2>Our Project</h2>
<br>
    <h3>Background</h3>
    <p>
    A full resolution image file of a typical Chandra observation using the
	ACIS instrument is 8192x8192 pixels.  Due to time constraints and
	calculation complexities of algorithms that analyze the data, sometimes
	concessions need to be made.  For example, CIAO provides a routine,
	<a href="http://goo.gl/qWBqe">dmimgadapt()</a>, that takes an image as input then
	adaptively smooths the image.  It does this by building a 2D box around
	each pixel until a user defined threshold is met, or a user defined max
	box size is encountered.  The complexity of the algorithm in worst case
	scenario is O(n^4).  Thus, with a large image, it can take days to achieve
	the output image. The data is usually scaled, or binned, by a factor
	of 8 in order to obtain a more manageable image size of 1024x1024.
	However, by doing so some of the finer detail of the image is lost.
	With this configuration, a typical file may take 30 minutes to produce
	an output file.  The goal of the project is to modify the dmimgadapt()
	routine from C-code to a more general python implementation.  Then we
	will implement a GPU version of the algorithm.  When finished, we want
	to drastically improve the runtime of the algorithm, via the GPU, and
	test the ability to run the algorithm on a full resolution 8192x8192
	image.
    </p>
    <br>
    <h3>Goal</h3>
<p>Parallelize the existing method to adaptively smooth an image. The current implementation is a serial algorithm called dmimgadapt().  Each pixel in the image is independently smoothed until a given threshold is met. This is used to smooth high contrast ratio images: the goal is to apply little smoothing to bright objects and large smoothing to the background; with a need to preserve the total energy (or flux).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Benefits</h2>
<br>
<p>The ability to implement the algorithm in parallel would have the ultimate benefit of speedup.  Currently using the serial implementation, smoothing a 1024x1024 algorithm takes roughly 30 minutes (depending on input parameters, hardware).  With a parallel implementation we hope to see dramatic improvement in run time.</p>
