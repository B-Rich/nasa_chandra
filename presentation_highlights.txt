Description from the course website:

Project Presentations
+ Your presentation is important for conveying the key ideas of your project. 

+ Each team will create a two minute screencast with narration showing a demo of your application and/or some slides. 

+ Focus the majority of your screencast on your main contributions rather than on technical details. 

+ What do you feel is the coolest part of your project? 

+ What insights did you gain? 

+ What is the single most important thing you would like to show the class? Make sure it is upfront and center rather than at the end.
